                        <h2>‚ùì What is this service?</h2>
                        <p>It‚Äôs a web tool that automatically generates personalized M3U playlists using your credentials (DNS, username/password, or M3U URL), eliminating the need for manual edits.</p>
                      </section>

                      <section>
                        <h2>‚ùì What‚Äôs the difference between Playlist and EPG?</h2>
                        <p>
                          A Playlist (M3U) contains the list of IPTV channels or streams ‚Äî basically the "what to watch".<br>
                          An EPG (Electronic Program Guide) provides schedule information ‚Äî the "when and what is on" for each channel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          They are separate but complementary: the playlist gives access to the streams, while the EPG shows the programming guide.
                        </p>

                      <section>
                        <h2>‚ùì How does it work?</h2>
                        <p>
                          In simple terms:<br>
                          Someone in the community carefully curates a custom list (M3U). They clean up unwanted channels, rename them properly, organize them into clear categories, improve logos, and add or fix the EPG. Sometimes they even add dummy EPGs for PPV channels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So instead of an unmanageable 30k-channel list, you get a polished manageable playlist ‚Äî all organized, with working logos, clear names, the best available quality, and a proper EPG.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Step by step:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Browse and select the desired service. Remember, you need to already have credentials for the service given by a provider.</li>
                          <li>Choose either <strong>Automatic process</strong> (recommended) or <strong>Manual process</strong> (if you have knowledge about this) in the modal.</li>
                          <li>Choose either <strong>M3U</strong> or <strong>Xtream</strong> in the modal.</li>
                          <li>Enter your credentials.</li>
                          <li>Click <strong>Generate M3U</strong> or <strong>Generate Xtream</strong>.</li>
                          <li>Your playlist is downloaded and shown with EPG info and GitHub URL. (If the process is taking too much time, consider disabling adblockers or use a different browser or device)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>‚ùì What if the Google Drive feature doesn‚Äôt work?</h2>
                        <p>Your browser may be blocking the Google login pop-up or Drive access. Try another browser, ensure pop-ups are allowed, and consider using a secondary Google account without 2FA, since it has been reported to break the login process in the repository.</p>

                        <h2>‚ùì Why does the EPG show ‚ÄúNo information‚Äù?</h2>
                        <p>EPG sync can take up to 30 minutes, depending on your channel count. If it still shows nothing after that, try using a VPN ‚Äî your ISP may be blocking the EPG server.</p>
